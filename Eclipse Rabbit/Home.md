The magician looked down at his attire and sighed deeply. There was only one explanation for the fact that he was crossdressing. In fact, anytime he was doing something crazy, there typically was only one person to blame.

"I can't believe Oracle dragged me into this nonsense."

His best friend was a children's book storywriter. That is where his nickname came from. Oracle, the one who see's through worlds to write stories. Perhaps as a result of his passion of being a writer, he also had the hobby of dressing up as the characters he created and attending events with likeminded individuals.

"If only he was not so good at seeing through people as well."

Perhaps Oracle had rubbed off on him, but the magician had given writing a try as well. Somehow Oracle had found out and teased him about it. If that was the end, then Magician wouldn't be this humiliated but it got worse.

The magician had challenged his best friend to seeing through his latest magic trick and the boy had happily obliged. The result had landed him in his current situation.

The humiliation of crossdressing was nothing compared to the humiliation of his new magic trick being seen through immediately.



The magician held the snow white card in his hand. Even though he practiced mundane magic all the time, such as making a coin disappear, this card was on a completely different level.

Whenever he touched the card, a soft warmth cycled through his body. There was just something magical about this otherwise ordinary white card. His years as a Magician told it to him.

"Even so, I can't believe Oracle dragged me into this."

The magician looked down at his attire and sighed deeply. There was only one explanation for the fact that he was crossdressing. Anytime something crazy happened, there was only one person to blame.

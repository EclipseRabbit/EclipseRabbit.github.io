The meaning of a Knight by Snow White:
A knight's role is to stand between the people and the despair that threatens to overwhelm them. A shield against the darkness.

Because of Snow's perception of a Knight, his behavior adjusts accordingly. In a sense, Snow is just a self proclaimed Knight and hence, he has the utmost respect for the real knights of the court.

Each of the Knight's are monster's on their own. Snow's own preconceived notion's of what a Knight is change his development course from the usual Knight.

Prince / Lord of Lies:
The power to turn a lie into truth, the power to manipulate fate and destiny to overrturn causality and make the lie become the truth.

Perhaps like the Level 5, invoking the name of the Lord of Lies can grant one power to temporary take refuge in a lie and gradually overrturn the inescapable truth.

A white lie can save hundreds while the cold truth slays thousands. False hope can doom you while despair can offer your heart a safe harbor.

Hope is something too distant for you to grasp so instead, your heart has taken refuge in the dark despair.
Even hope can be the cruelest blade to those whose hearts seek refuge in despair.

Overcome it or take refuge in it and forge a blade with your heart. Make the false true. Transform despair into hope.

Whether full of hope or heavy with despair, whether it be through the cold truth or a white lie, take up your blade and stand proud. You are a champion of my cause. For as soon as you have entered the gates of my kingdom, you have become one of my knights.

Gather up the light of the world.
Come forth, Excalibur!

Head Knight <- Blacksmith / <- Female / Mother <- Makes references to a good blade must be reforged over and over again.
Princess <- Sage <- Female

Eldest Princess <- Fiona(?)
Nah... Badass princess that is so charasmatic that she can control all the summoned heroes.
Listen to me because I am royalty type style.
None of the heroes can beat her. True hero only draws her (gaining her interest).

Haughty, arrogant, prideful. Attitude changes against someone she recognizes as an equal.

Forced to bend the knee, everyone listens to her. Can't be beat. Radiates presence of royalty. So far above class / teacher in everything. "Monster".

Reclined as if without any worries.

goddess / beast, nightmare / dream. Lucky to see her. Smug? Confident. Know's she is beautiful and flaunts it. Enjoys attention, no command's attention with her every gesture. Can not be ignored.

Eldest (2nd oldest) Prince <- Future King Appears polite and nice on the surface, is actually a black bellied king.

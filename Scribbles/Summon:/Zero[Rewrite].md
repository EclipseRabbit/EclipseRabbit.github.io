## Summon Zero

#### Chapter 0

Under the gloomy sky that threatened to rain, a boy exited the cake shop with a white box in his hands. The world was gray. No matter how bright he smiled, no matter how cheerful he pretended to be, the world remained gray. A chill had lodged itself deep in its heart and his warm jacket did nothing to dispel it. Color had vanished from the world ever since that day, leaving only a dull gray behind.

The boy reached for his smartphone and had it loop on a special song. A gentle tune rang in his ears through his headphones, and a hint of color entered the world. If he could sing loud enough, perhaps it would be enough to change the world. But then the song ended, the magic faded, and the dull gray returned.

The song was incomplete, a spell half finished. The world could not be changed so easily. The boy returned home with the white box just as darkness swallowed the world.

A bleak, messy room greeted him. The tune he hummed faltered. Taking a deep breath, he plastered a mask of cheerfulness on his face as the lights switched on.

“I am home!”

There was nobody to answer him.

The boy cleared the kitchen table of leftover cup noodles and set down his bundle. His hands reached into the box and took out an extravagant white cake. The words ‘Happy Birthday Sion!’ were written with icing. Various fantasy creatures from a popular smartphone game decorated the cream. Eighteen candles adorned the perimeter of the cake.

“Wow!”

The boy, Sion, smiled at the sight of the cake. It took him a few moments of searching before he found the lighter and lit the candles. With the preparations complete, he turned off the lights and sat in the special chair.

Sion looked the cake under the flickering candlelight blankly. A picture on a wooden stand besides the table drew his attention. In the picture, a family of three smiled happily as if they would never be separated. Sion’s fake smile disappeared and he turned back to the cake.

He opened his mouth to sing. No words came out. The sudden futility of the situation hit him and he sat there in silence. It was just the cake and him. Time dragged out under the faltering flames. Making up his mind, Sion closed his eyes, took a deep breath, made a wish, and then--

A notification buzzed on his smartphone. The flames on the candle flickered, but none of them went out. A hint of a smile ghosted across his face at his failure to blow out all the candles before the smile disappeared from the world.

Muttering to himself, Sion took a glance at his phone and froze. The notification was from the app Dungeon Meister, a popular mobile rpg game. That by itself was not uncommon, but the notification was not related to any game event he knew of.

“Do you want to know the truth?”

It was a simple question with a simple answer. If it was any other application on his phone, Sion would simply have clicked no and be done with it. Instead, he hit the yes button.

“Are you sure you want to know the truth? This decision will be irrevocable.”

Sion paused at the warning. His gaze went back to the picture frame on the cabinet, to the three happy smiles that had been lost. When it finally returned to his phone, his eyes showed a firm resolve.

“Yes.”

A sudden wind blew out all the candles, plunging the room into darkness. A glowing blue light encircled his phone. The blue light spread to fill the entire room and 18 blue flames lit on the cake.

“Ah!”

Sion dropped his phone, or tried to, but it was glued to his hand. No matter how he shook his hand, the phone remained stuck. A magical warmth crept up through the phone and invaded his body.

Sion backed up until he ran into the wall, cold sweat dripping down his back. Light spread out from his phone and formed a circle around his hand. Complex runes carved themselves in the air and an unknown script filled the circle. As magical circle spun, the runes changed forms.

The intensity of the light grew stronger  Searing heat radiated off his phone. The magic circle grew bigger and soon engulfed his whole body. Sion was swallowed in a blinding flash of light as the world shifted.

His sight was the first to go. Hot surges altered his body, certainly and irrevocably. Hearing vanished. One by one, his senses shut down. Taste disappeared. Smell followed soon after. Touch was the last to go, and with it, all that was left was a vague darkness.

Time lost its meaning. Life and death were out of his control. He was a helpless bystander to the machinations of fate.

With a brilliant flash of white, Sion's world faded to darkness.

##### Chapter 0.5

Sion woke up to that hateful gray. Even after such a magical event, the world remained unchanged.

Once his vision cleared, he realized his mistake. It could certainly be called gray, but doing so would be an injustice. His mind wandered. A hint of recognition tickled his heart and a certain doubt filled the corners  of his mind, just out of reach.

It was a familiar color. Rather than gray, it was more of a white or silver. Strands of long white-silver hair peeked out from the corner of his vision. Under the slightest reflection of light, they changed into a myriad of colors like a rainbow.

It reminded him of...

"Zero..."

A voice spoke up in awe. Sion turned towards that familiar voice and froze in shock.

Across the room on against the wall was a very familiar boy. He had the same brown hair that reached his eyes and was wearing a Homura Academy uniform. The boy's eyes were wide open in surprise.

"That is... me?"

Sion spoke up, confused. Somehow his voice sounded different than usual.

"You are Zero, right?"

The boy across from Sion spoke up once more.

"No, Zero is..."

Sion spoke up, the feeling of unease inside of him strengthened. Something was seriously wrong. Whenever he spoke, it wasn't his voice that came out.

"I am Sion. Zero is my game character."

"Impossible," the boy denied. "I am Sion."

"Huh?"

Sion stared at the boy who looked exactly like him dumbfounded.

"In the first place, you do not look anything like me. Instead, you look exactly like Zero."

"What are you talking about--"

Sion paused as another strand of silver hair appeared in his vision. Even to his own ears, his voice sounded foreign. The doubts clamoring around inside his head became stronger.

Finally, he looked down.

"Ah..."

Sion couldn't deny the situation anymore. The two mounds attached to his... her chest could not be ignored. Rather than her familiar Homura Academy school uniform, she was wearing a snow white coat over a black dress shirt with blue jeans. Her appearance was not unfamiliar to her.

"This is the modern day Summoner outfit I had on Zero. I am Zero..?"

Sion, no, Zero muttered absentmindedly.

"...Did she inherit all of my memories as well?"

The voice that reached Zero's ears brought her thoughts to a halt. Inherit memories? That made it sounded like she is not the real Sion Asterfield.

"These memories are mine. I was Sion Asterfield up until I clicked the button and now suddenly, I became Zero."

The self proclaimed Sion Asterfield sighed in response.

"Now listen, you might believe yourself to be me but I have proof otherwise."

"Oh?" Zero challenged back in response.

"First our positions. When I clicked the button, I was near this wall, not in the center of the room."

Zero froze. Now that she thought about it, the position she woke up in was odd. Like 'Sion' had said, she was certain she had been by the birthday cake when she clicked the got the notification on her phone.

"Second. I have possession of the phone. You do not." Sion lifted the phone in his hand.

"And finally, do you remember my... no, our wish?"

Zero knew what he was talking about. The wish she made deep in her heart before she was about to blow out the candles. The notification had interrupted her, but perhaps it was merely another form of bringing about that wish.

The character Zero was a joint project of the three of them, one of the few legacies left behind along with the incomplete song. White-silver long hair that flowed like quicksilver. Long eyelashes framed her brilliant sky blue eyes. Possessing both beauty and strength, Zero was a character that gradually disappeared from the world of Dungeon Meister.

"I am a fake...?"

Zero looked down at herself. Her hands trembled as the foundations of her world tore themselves apart at the seams.

"Everything I remember is a lie..?"

It was too much to take. If she wasn't Sion Asterfield, then were the people that were the most important people to her still her family?

Would she even matter to them or was she just a temporary illusion that would be abandoned?

No, the girl thought as she searched through her memories. Even if she could not be 'Sion Asterfield,' this was an equally precious form to take. After all, it was one of the few legacies she had left of them.

Zero clenched her fist and muttered sadly.

"After all, I am Zero..."

## A Certain Heretical Witch



## Artificial Spirit

### Arc Zero - Underground Research Facility
#### Chapter Zero: Jailbreak

In front, blue sky met crystal clear water across the horizon. Half the world shimmered like a mirror, the other stretched to the heavens. Soft white clouds drifting aimlessly. Unknown depths hid beneath the surface of the water.

There was neither sun nor moon. The stars were absent. There were no celestial bodies to call for guidance, only the endless blue expanse.

Behind lay darkness. Cracks spread throughout the world. Pieces shattered like glass, drawn and swallowed into the gaping abyss.

Step by step, the boy left a piece of himself behind in this virtual world.

Unsurprisingly, the tortoise was the first to fall. Being slow and steady was not worth a damn when the world collapsed on you.

Beasts and monsters of all sort raced against the collapsing world. The boy felt hopelessly outmatched. He knew that he truly only had one advantage over his competitors.

Of all the beings bound in this collapsing virtual world, his form was the stablest. Of all the beings bound to this cruel experiment, he was the last to join this race.

Great beings the boy could never hope to match fell left and right behind him. When over half of them were swallowed by the abyss, a great ripple went through the world. Foreign sensations assaulted his spirit and he stumbled.

Almost a quarter of the remaining survivors immediately retired at that point. It was only the strong rejection that filled the boy that allowed his feet to continue forward.

The water below him rippled and a new world appeared before him…

Green liquid flowed around her body...

No, the boy shook the phantom sensations away, that was not his body.

Her eyes opened up to see a researcher standing in front of her with a clipboard.

"Initiating startup protocol"

Even from the other side of the world, the boy shivered at the inorganic nature of the voice. Yet, the researcher paid it no mind as if he had expected such an unnatural thing.

All of a sudden... the boy felt very sleepy...

Horns and tail appear when using magic power/fighting (with a black flame).
(Demon body, dragonheart?)


Hidden attributes:
Part dragon race
Irises become vertical slits when dragon attributes activate
Class: Princess
Typically demons have tattoos that represent their power, but these are absent on Raine due to her half dragon nature (and cursed child status).
Immense magical prowess.
Tremendous bad luck(white haired demon cursed child) canceled out by tremendous luck(dragon race)

Snow suppress her Titan attributes via close proximity to Raine's dragon attributes. Likewise for Raine. As a result, the demon and angel attributes that are usual in opposition sync up to double team dragon/titan and thus, become the dominant characteristic for Raine/Snow.

But when one of them is hurt very badly, dormant attributes might wake up and cause powers to run berserk.

Races:
Deity(Ancient gods)
Titan <--- titan strength/durability/regeneration
Dragon <-- dragonfear, whole body is a weapon/treasure
Elves <-- long ears, nature bonuses
Human
Beastman <--- and humans have highest population.
Demon <--- Store items/spells in tattoos on body and power them up
Angel <--- wings to use magic, physical wings? Fallen has magic power wings

## Eleventh Hour

Rain fell endlessly from the sky. The sun hid behind the clouds as if abandoning those below. The houses towered over the fallen boy, lined up orderly like silent gravestones in a graveyard.

Cold. It was too cold, the boy thought. All warmth fled away from the gaping hole in him.

"Is this..."

How it is going to end? The boy wasn't even able to finish the words.


## Eleventh Hour 2

The idea behind this one is that instead of  focusing on fights, look into relationships? I was thinking something like original main character (One not Zero) has his own group, and then Raine Vesper gets her own group. The two are like good and evil so they are constantly in conflict. Unfortunately, the MC's side is the bad/evil side, or so it appears. They might not necessarily be bad but resource starved. You have a cursed demon, a fallen angel, a dark elf, a dark magical girl, a fallen noble of a sci-fi world, and so on.

(Yeah, this is definitely easier to type on than my computer's keyboard. Maybe I will start bringing my laptop bag to work since that will probably be easier than this.)

Rain fell endlessly from the sky. The sun hid behind the clouds, as if abandoning those below. Houses towered over the fallen boy, orderly like silent gravestones.

Cold. It was really too cold. Warmth abandoned the boy, spilling freely from the gaping hole in him.

Was this really how it was going to end, the boy could not help but wonder.

Was his life going to end so abruptly?

As his consciousness grew distant, a change overcame the world. It took his blury consciousness a moment to realize the change.

"...?"

The rain had stopped. No, that was wrong. The rain had not stopped. The rain was frozen in midair. It was not just the rain. The entire world had halted, as if frozen in time.

The shadows pooled together and a woman appeared above the fallen boy.

"And so yet another one of us meets their end..."

The woman's voice was flat, yet her eyes held an unmistakable helplessness within them.

"We ask of thee, do you wish to live?"

A solemn proclamation, a solemn question. The boy had but only one answer to give.

"I..."

His throat would not cooperate. Even so, with his fading strength, he forced out the words.

"...want to live!"

"You can not be saved. Your future is shrouded in darkness. All paths forward end rather abruptly. Even so, to fulfill that meager wish of yours, are you willing to open Pandora's Box?"

A black box that swallowed all the surrounding light appeared above the woman's hand and floated down to the boy. With no hesitation the boy reached out and grabbed the box.

Immediately, warmth surged through his veins. The gaping hole inside of him disappeared, and he was made whole again.

"Cinderella's magic ended at midnight. So too shall yours. May you fulfill our wish and overcome destiny itself."

With heat inside the boy's body overflowed and his vision went white. The last thing he saw before his consciousness completely faded was the single look of sorrow on the woman's face.


---
Sound returned first. The swaying of leaves as a breeze passed through. The constant pitter patter of rain as it fell from the sky, forming small puddles below.

Smell was the next to return. The soft green of the grass below. Nature in its full breath, an unusual scent for one who grew up in the city.

The soft texture of the grass underneath. The occasional raindrop that made it through the tree and rolled off of his face.

The boy opened his eyes. He was no longer dying in the middle of the street. Instead, he found himself in a park on a small hill under the tree. The only constant between the two situations was that it was still raining, meaning he was probably still in the same city.

Rain... Remembering how all the raindrops had frozen in midair when he was talking to that girl, he could not help but pinch himself. Everything felt like a dream to him. Yet, even in this dream, several warning signs were firing off in his mind.

Everything felt... different. The world had more color, everything was clearer, and warmth flowed freely throughout his body. The boy absent mindedly reached up to pinch himself. Pain ran through his cheeks. It wasn't a dream. Even so...

"Were my cheeks always this soft..?"

A voice that chimed like a bell that he did not recognize spoke up at the same time, with the same words as him. No, that wasn't right...

Thinking of all the odd sensations he felt since waking up, the boy scrambled over to the small puddle at the base of the tree. Even though the occasional droplets caused ripples in the puddle, he could still make out his reflection on the surface.

He... no, she started in mute shock. Her savior's words echoed through her head.

"Cinderella's magic ended at midnight..."

The girl repeated the word's that the black-haired woman had told her. She had not understood their meaning until now, but staring at her reflection brought forward a new sense of clarity. The girt in the reflection had long blue hair that spilled down to her waist. One eye was sky blue. The other was gold with a clock inlaid on it, pointing at 1 o'clock. A clock within her eye...

"Midnight..?"

What would happen when midnight came around? If the magic that saved her life wore off, would she die? A shiver went down the blue-haired girl's spine as she thought of dying a second time.

...There just was not enough time to do everything she wanted to do if that was the case.

The black-haired girl had given her something that she had called Pandora's Box. If the box belonged to her savior, then that meant her name was...

"Pandora."

An odd feeling filled her. The magic that had saved her was called Pandora's box. If one took both the myth and Pandora's words into account, then that meant endless despair awaited her.

"No... that is not right."

In the myth, Pandora opening the box brought despair to the entire world and yet, hope was hidden at the very bottom. Was there a deeper meaning hidden in Pandora's words?

The girl shook her head to clear the gloomy thoughts and examined herself.

If she squinted just right, she could see a passing resemblance between herself and Pandora.

The sound of footsteps through the growing puddles brought the girl out of her introspection. Looking towards the sound, the girl who had hair the color of sky saw another girl in her school's uniform walking through the empty park.

At the same time, the girl with snow white hair saw her as well.

"Have you seen a pink haired"







## Forsaken

Constraints:
Mute (Lost his voice to sickness)
Lost touch, voice, taste.

Will lose:
Sight, smell

Last moments
Lose all 5 senses.

Uses “demon arts” (spirit arts) to talk, every time he uses demon arts, his lifespan reduces.

Demon - a creature born from darkness


Initial mission: encounters a spirit lord, Pandora’s Vessel (Witch).

Forsaken
A group of people abandoned by the world, doomed to a certain death. They have come to also be known as Pandora’s Chosen. Those marked by Pandora will eventually be reclaimed by her, their sanity eroded and their form subverted into that of a monster. The only way to escape her grasp is to die before the mark is activated.

They are greatly feared by the general populace because it is never known then their curse will erupt, turning them into a bloodthirsty monster.

Forsaken gain the ability to use “demon arts,” special abilities that put them above the general populace. Each use of demon arts brings them closer to death, or the curses violent eruption.

Organization: Fractal
A gathering of “demon arts practitioners,” or the Forsaken. The ultimate goal is to investigate and cure the Forsaken.

Organization: Nightfall
Born form the collapse of Fractal, an extremist group that desires the end of the world (to reach the eternal night). A gathering of “demon arts practitioners,” with some religious connotation around the end of the world. The only way to reach “Pandora” is through the world’s end or death. The ones marked by Pandora are called Forsaken, abandoned by the world and doomed to a certain death. Saint’s of the Forsaken are called “Witches” and wield immense powers.

Witches’ Blessing, Pandora’s chosen, Pandora’s mark, Devil’s Flower, The black flower (spoken for the flower like pattern that the mark takes).

Witches
Pandora’s vessels, those that have completely surrendered to pandora and are incarnations of all the world’s evils. The organization Fractal is their archnemesis, as they seek to cure the disease, thus weakening Pandora’s power.


Pandora
A false entity born from all the resentment of the fallen Forsaken who had their life cut short. Desires the destruction of the world and can send messages to her seven sins(witches).

#### August 15th, 2019

Hmm, like the mix of Everdistant Horizon(Original) and Infinite Horizon, but can I modify the main character any? Though I do not know what kind of main character I am looking for, I want something different from Zero.

Actually, I still like Zero, but I might want to change her background. I like Lightning a lot and I like Lightning's background. The question is how can I improve it?

Lightning Miyamoto
Descendant of Musashi Miyamoto (Grandfather side) and King Arthur (Grandmother side). Excalibur fragments are stolen and brought to the city that Lightning lives in, jump starting the story.

Lightning, as in Lightgard. The Lightgard family is Lightning's mother side, but since she took Miyamoto name, Lightning is a reference to her past family.

Now I just need a plot/setting. Well, I have the basic plot. Lightning finds the lost Excalibur Fragment and her family comes to retrieve it. Hijinks ensue after that.

Hmm... Lightning is aware of her relationship to the Lightgard family. Perhaps they are ignorant of the relationship, or even better, they are looking for the lost relative?

Hmm... even so, I am missing a "trigger event". It is supposed to be when Lightning finds the sword but I am unsure of how to cause that to happen. Dying exorcist drops the sword off at her house/dojo and then leaves it be?

If this is Zero/Lightning story, then how does Lightning die? Perhaps that doesn't need to be decided yet and I can instead just start with Zero recovering. Now then... will this be an Infinite Horizon style sotry with Creature/Psyche/Mecha or will this be a normal story.

Advantages of having Lightning as an informational body is that she can dive through past memories through the bloodline to power up.

Advantages of having Lightning as a spirit is that she can resonate and own world/personal reality is a lot better/makes more sense.

Perhaps I should start it off with body/mind/magic? If there are clearly defined levels, then it doesn't make sense for a noob to beat a strong person. And yet, vice versa, borrowing the power of an OP person might make it work.

Body/Creature: Lightning (Miyamoto Demon Seal/Pandora)
Magic/World/Mecha: Zero (Excalibur)
Mind/Psyche: Aria?   (Personal Reality)


Body/Creature
Demon, Monster, Calamity Star,

Magic:
Sage, Magician, Wizard, Sorcerer

Mind/Psychic
Warlock? Arcanist? Esper? Level 0-5, Divine? Demigod? Deity? Philosopher? Scholar?

Magic: Magician
Pscyhe: Mystic
Creature: Guardian

Magic = Everdistant Horizon
Body/Creature = Pandora (Miyamoto Demon Seal)
Mind/Psyche: Everdistant Horizon

Thinking about it, great demon calamity is born into the world. Light happens to witness it? Or is in wrong place at wrong time? Perhaps she decides she will uphold the family legacy even though she is powerless?

Light absorbs part of the demon using the Miyamoto demon sealing art. Severely injured as a result and this also creates "Snow White". Perhaps Snow White's true name is "Raine Vesper".

Snow White is comfortable near Zero because of how Everdistant Horizon prevents the world from attacking her. Main body is sealed inside of Lightning?

Perhaps due to the nature of Everdistant Horizon, Snow White feels safe/world can not reach her anywhere inside the city. It is like a bomb that hasn't exploded yet and nobody knows when it will detonate.

Because main body is sealed inside of Lightning, feels close with Lightning. Also feels safe/protected due to the nature of Everdistant Horizon.

It is only because main body is sealed that Snow White feels the presence of Everdistant Horizon?

No, perhaps that is wrong. Snow White is an informational body born from the sealed demon that is reflected to the real world due to Everdistant Horizon. In a sense, Lightning's body is not near strong enough to hold Snow White prisoner so the seal is within the reflection of Horizon.

#### August 1st, 2019

This sounds very dumb in hindsight because it isn't something I can share with my parents but whatevs.

Magical Girl versus Demon Girl. Do I want to do eleventh hour style world?

MC clicks a button or gets attacked and dying when Pandora shows up and gives him the power to transform?

If dying, has a very different vibe than if he clicks the button of his own desire.

Perhaps when he clicks the button, the world freezes and Pandora appears and grants him the ability to turn into a magical girl... Yeah, I like that idea.

Now who is Pandora in relationship to the main character? Alternate self? Infinite clones that failed. Perhaps Pandora is the final boss? No, the final boss is Zero. Or perhaps there is a conflict of Pandora versus Zero, original self versus hatred of all the copies.

Regardless of the true scenario, all of this will be behind the scenes. I will keep Pandora and Zero true, but they might not be based off the main character at all.

Hmm, the goal is a lighthearted comedy with a dark backstory that is in the background. Perhaps a little more thought reveals the world is darker than it first appears?

Regardless, how should the intro scene be set up? Perhaps a smartphone notification on related to a gacha game that he commonly plays?

I am going to laugh, but he is taught magic by his rival, the demon White Darkness(Who is actually a small fry).

Perhaps White Darkness grows through her relationship with the main character (Lightning).

All magical events are forgotten by those without magical power. Hence, the world moves on without the acknowledgment of anything magical happening and people at large do not recognize the existence of magic.

By this same principle, someone with a large enough magic power might be forgotten even by those with magic (for example Zero).

Perhaps it can be thought of as one's personal reality, the way they view the world, limits what they can see and remember. Because of this, becoming a magical girl "Enlightens" or "Awakens" and the world is forever different.

MC goes to a school where the "Light" clan reigns supreme.

Because of difference in mana, White Darkness forgets the true appearance of Pandora, only remembering that she had black hair. In a sense, Darkness is looking for Pandora just like Raine Vesper.

Initially, "Cinderella's magic ends at midnight." Since Raine takes control of the magic before midnight, the black choker containing Pandora's box breaks and the clock in her eye freezes. But this is a special case. She doesn't have much more time and every time she transforms in the future, she has a strict limit.

The Main Character's family and sister are MIA. This isn't immediately obvious until later on in the series. He has been going to school several times. This is his 11th year, perhaps. His sister was 12 years younger than him (6 at the time) when he graduated from

Loop Zero Year 1 - 4th
Year 4 - 4th
Year 8 - 4th
Year 12 - 4th

3rd loop, 4th time attending same school.
11 years have passed.

Transform in the Spring before graduation.
Story starts in the Autumn of the final year.

11 years, 11 hours.
10 years since the "Miracle" that happened in the town, causing the rumor of Zero/ the one with white hair being able to grant wishes.

Because Snow White can vaguely remember Pandora, she is treated as someone who must be protected by Pandora, despite the fact that she is a walking curse.

Snow White's curse is related to Time and Distance. Because Lightning is a master of Time, she can halt the effects of the curse...

I have written this far but still do not have anything for how to start the story.

In my mind, Raine clicks the app, world freezes with raindrops suspended in midair, Pandora shows up and offers black box. Raine takes the box and opens it.

Marvels at how body is light (Lightning). Snow White appears and demands a duel. They play tag instead. Snow White is extremely weak (curse). Lightning is extremely weak (just became a magical girl).

As such, they become bitter rivals.

Penalty Games galore, would be kinda funny.

When Raine see's original's crush, body gets hot and almost loses conciousness.

Turns into Lightning/Light. (White and Black) (Light and Darkness)

Tails (Tailor) (Kitsune/ Fox)

Black (Blacksmith)

Art (Artist)

Oracle (Storybook writer)

Sage

Prince

Magician

Raine Vesper

Lucia Featherfall / Felicia / Fel

Black creates the sword
Art creates the art in the Storybook
Tails creates the clothes
Prince gives advice on the behavior


Many ideas are swirling around in my head. Basically the appearance the MC takes is the one that his friends left behind for him.

His greatest enemy is himself, so they make a plan for him to become someone else.

Dragon princess dragonfear condenses mana, perhaps while under the affects of her mana, he forms a core himself, becoming able to use magic?

I kinda want to bring in Light(ning) as an alternate appearance. Part of the issue I am running into is that if female form is OP and is what the entire story is about, then what is the point of the male form or the gender bender?

Actually, part of the idea could be that the female form is crossdressing as her male appearance?

I like the idea of the main character having many friends that help support him.

What is Lightning's motivation for being a hero? When young, ran away from it after being called a monster. In fact, being a hero might be the furthest thing on her mind.


Summon Zero style story but put it in Hero x Rabbit x Magician? Problem with this is how do we transition from ordinary world without monsters to world with monsters? Put them as two separate sphere's that can not influence eachother? Perhaps human app game world can only be seen and accessed by humans?

Zero is actually a cursed demon just like snow white/raine vesper. They can summon things from their imagination, which is why Zero can summon items from the game and Raine just makes black swords.

Draws excalibur and uses the image inside excalibur to remake body?

#### July 19th, 2019

Lets see... I am thinking Honkai Impact 3 and Snow White crossover. What should the main character's true name be? Well, I am thinking Sion, lets just go with that for now.

Hmm... this is a good compromise but not as good as the keyboard I took home. Too awkward in typing and the feeback is bad. Maybe I will have to actually buy a better keyboard to continue. Oh well, this works kinda... Just don't like typing with it that much.

Sion ran away from home. He has been running away from his responsibilities as one of the Lightguard house.

No, perhaps he calls himself Light when he changes appearance? That would not be too bad.

"An ordinary hero"

When Sion finally decides to stop running, he has to sacrifice all of his past hardwork.

Perhaps it is something he always wanted to do, but now that he has to do it, he feels melancholy about it.

Name is Lightning (Light) for short.

#### July 12th, 2019

Thoughts from a dream: Boy goes on a mission to investigate something as part of his organization. Perhaps a girl's Frontline kind of thing. His results are unknown and then he comes back to the base only to realize it has been destroyed by the enemy. Perhaps it is like summoning a hero and binding them to a contract. Commander in charge of forces. Anyways, that was a dream I had.

Meantime, I was thinking about trying a dungeon master kind of story. Black versus White where rabbit's are children on the moon. The two fight endlessly giving birth to monster/children/rabbit's from their conflict? But I can't think of a story for this particular instance so it is probably a no go.

Another one I am interested in is the Magician using cards. Only problem is logistics of points and how they work. Also, is the entire story about getting points or is the entire story about something else? That is one big issue it faces, but I like how all of the characters can appear as enemies. No, that is perhaps the main draw of the story to me is that the love interests are the antagonists.

It also helps that the main character has 2 types of combat. By himself as Snow White and together with his friends as Magician. Of course, trying to figure out the logistics of how points work is a pain and min maxing those also doesn't help.

#### July 10th, 2019

Okay, so I just want to write a fun story. How do I go about that? Ignore everything else, I want to write a story where the main character has fun. Perhaps because that is the focus of the story, he gets caught up with some unusual characters.

Found a dungeon core and everyone else wants a piece of it? Everyone has a core and racing to get first?

Demon - Raine Vesper / Snow White
Fallen - Fel (Felicia)
Dark Elf -


#### July 8th, 2019

Kinda want to write the everdistant horizon original version, where black box/pandora's box and the search for being able to draw forth the holy sword to save the world.

Actually, perhaps it isn't too hard to save the world, but it is impossible to save Pandora who is trapped in the cube. Each version of MC must make a choice to save the world, fail and be swallowed by Pandora, or save Pandora and take the extreme hard mode route.

Only way to save the world is to draw the holy sword?

Idea \#2, that I am kinda leaning towards:
White card falls from the heavens and allows the main character to join the academy of magic. Well, to take the entrance exam towards the academy.

#### July 4th, 2019

Let's see. Looking back at my original motivation to writing Alter Trigger, Limit Break, and Sorrow's End, well not really Sorrow's End, but the other few that I really enjoyed. I want the main character to do something absolutely incredible in his female form and become famous for it?

The question is how to go about that. I abandoned Limit Break because of the issue that once the main character became a ranker, none of his friends ever had any shot of matching up to his potential.

I do not want a character that leaves everyone else behind and has unsurpassed potential. The issue with freely switching between forms is that there is the possibility that one form (male) becomes completely redundant after a period of time. If the main character is friends with everyone as female self, will male self ever get any screen time? Is it even worth writing about his male self if the female self is the only thing that is important?

Alter Trigger had an interesting take on that in that the male self eventually disappeared.

I guess the issue is that it is hard to write about switching in between forms without some kind of gimmick like superpowers. So now that I have said that, is there anything that comes to mind?

...Nope.

Another issue with limit break is a fight will only have tension of limit break is used every fight. I want to avoid that.


#### July 2nd, 2019

I want to write something like snow white order where the main character finds himself in the middle of a warzone and panics, having no idea what is going on. It is only because there is a more experienced person with them that he survives.

Perhaps tries to figure out self and sudden changes while panicking? But for some reason, I don't want to do it with exiting stories in my mind. Eleventh hour could work but that seems more like a slice of life style story, rather than the initial panic.

Star Magic? Well, if I start it with the first dream, then that might work but that falls into the same problem of not wanting to write a series that focuses heavily on things that do not happen in the real world. Infinite Horizon could work but the setup would have to be readjusted.

I like the idea of instance dungeon areas that people can go to to battle or whatever. Both Eleventh Hour and infinite horizon implement this idea. But I dunno.

Artificial Spirit? It does fit, but at the same time it doesn't. Hmm, part of the idea is that I like that Snow White Order, the main character knows what is going on but has no idea what they are doing in that particular scenario. Also, they recognize the person that is helping them but never knew them personally. They are also completely scared out of their mind and desperation fuels all of their actions.

Could a story with such desperation and survival live in the long run? That is the issue I have with most "survival" stories is that once we get passed the initial survival mode, then it immediately gets boring. Hmm... will have to think about it but in the meantime, I will have to get back to work. Nevermind, still have 5 more minutes.

Did I come up with anything out of this? Not really. Well, it was nice to sit down and type something, even if that did not translate to a story itself.

My ideas for the main character: Succubus, Cursed Child, Magical Girl, Homunculus, Hero, game character turned real, Transformed by holy sword, Witch(Snow White/A Certain Heretical Witch), Invaded by curses/the world, waking up in siblings body(Everdistant Horizon), Pandora's Box(Original Everdistant). Lets get this into a bulleted list.

- Succubus
- Cursed child
- Magical girl
- Homunculus
- Hero
- game character
- Witch
- Pandora's box
- Possessing sibling

## A Certain Heretical Witch



## Artificial Spirit

### Arc Zero - Underground Research Facility
#### Chapter Zero: Jailbreak

In front, blue sky met crystal clear water across the horizon. Half the world shimmered like a mirror, the other stretched to the heavens. Soft white clouds drifting aimlessly. Unknown depths hid beneath the surface of the water.

There was neither sun nor moon. The stars were absent. There were no celestial bodies to call for guidance, only the endless blue expanse.

Behind lay darkness. Cracks spread throughout the world. Pieces shattered like glass, drawn and swallowed into the gaping abyss.

Step by step, the boy left a piece of himself behind in this virtual world.

Unsurprisingly, the tortoise was the first to fall. Being slow and steady was not worth a damn when the world collapsed on you.

Beasts and monsters of all sort raced against the collapsing world. The boy felt hopelessly outmatched. He knew that he truly only had one advantage over his competitors.

Of all the beings bound in this collapsing virtual world, his form was the stablest. Of all the beings bound to this cruel experiment, he was the last to join this race.

Great beings the boy could never hope to match fell left and right behind him. When over half of them were swallowed by the abyss, a great ripple went through the world. Foreign sensations assaulted his spirit and he stumbled.

Almost a quarter of the remaining survivors immediately retired at that point. It was only the strong rejection that filled the boy that allowed his feet to continue forward.

The water below him rippled and a new world appeared before him…

Green liquid flowed around her body...

No, the boy shook the phantom sensations away, that was not his body.

Her eyes opened up to see a researcher standing in front of her with a clipboard.

"Initiating startup protocol"

Even from the other side of the world, the boy shivered at the inorganic nature of the voice. Yet, the researcher paid it no mind as if he had expected such an unnatural thing.

All of a sudden... the boy felt very sleepy...

(Demon body, dragonheart?)


Hidden attributes:
Part dragon race
Irises become vertical slits when dragon attributes activate

Dragon opposes Titan
Demon opposes Angel

Snow suppress her Titan attributes via close proximity to Raine's dragon attributes. Likewise for Raine. As a result, the demon and angel attributes that are usual in opposition sync up to double team dragon/titan and thus, become the dominant characteristic for Raine/Snow.

But when one of them is hurt very badly, dormant attributes might wake up and cause powers to run berserk.

Races:
Deity(Ancient gods)
Titan <--- titan strength/durability/regeneration
Dragon <-- dragonfear, whole body is a weapon/treasure
Elves <-- long ears, nature bonuses
Human
Beastman <--- and humans have highest population.
Demon <--- Store items/spells in tattoos on body and power them up
Angel <--- wings to use magic, physical wings? Fallen has magic power wings
Dwarf <-- crafting/immense strength/dex low agi/magic. Short.

Population wise(ranks)

Titan
Dragon
Elves
Dwarf
Angel
Demon
Human
Beastman


## Eleventh Hour

Rain fell endlessly from the sky. The sun hid behind the clouds as if abandoning those below. The houses towered over the fallen boy, lined up orderly like silent gravestones in a graveyard.

Cold. It was too cold, the boy thought. All warmth fled away from the gaping hole in him.

"Is this..."

How it is going to end? The boy wasn't even able to finish the words.


## Eleventh Hour 2

The idea behind this one is that instead of  focusing on fights, look into relationships? I was thinking something like original main character (One not Zero) has his own group, and then Raine Vesper gets her own group. The two are like good and evil so they are constantly in conflict. Unfortunately, the MC's side is the bad/evil side, or so it appears. They might not necessarily be bad but resource starved. You have a cursed demon, a fallen angel, a dark elf, a dark magical girl, a fallen noble of a sci-fi world, and so on.

(Yeah, this is definitely easier to type on than my computer's keyboard. Maybe I will start bringing my laptop bag to work since that will probably be easier than this.)

Rain fell endlessly from the sky. The sun hid behind the clouds, as if abandoning those below. Houses towered over the fallen boy, orderly like silent gravestones.

Cold. It was really too cold. Warmth abandoned the boy, spilling freely from the gaping hole in him.

Was this really how it was going to end, the boy could not help but wonder.

Was his life going to end so abruptly?

As his consciousness grew distant, a change overcame the world. It took his blury consciousness a moment to realize the change.

"...?"

The rain had stopped. No, that was wrong. The rain had not stopped. The rain was frozen in midair. It was not just the rain. The entire world had halted, as if frozen in time.

The shadows pooled together and a woman appeared above the fallen boy.

"And so yet another one of us meets their end..."

The woman's voice was flat, yet her eyes held an unmistakable helplessness within them.

"We ask of thee, do you wish to live?"

A solemn proclamation, a solemn question. The boy had but only one answer to give.

"I..."

His throat would not cooperate. Even so, with his fading strength, he forced out the words.

"...want to live!"

"You can not be saved. Your future is shrouded in darkness. All paths forward end rather abruptly. Even so, to fulfill that meager wish of yours, are you willing to open Pandora's Box?"

A black box that swallowed all the surrounding light appeared above the woman's hand and floated down to the boy. With no hestiation the boy reached out and grabbed the box.

immediately, warmth surged through his veins. The gaping hole inside of him disappeared, and he was made whole again.

"Cinderella's magic ended at midnight. So too shall you struggle. May you fulfill our wish and overcome destiny itself."

With heat inside the boy's body overflowed and his vision went white. The last thing he saw before his consciousness completely faded was the single look of sorrow on the woman's face.


---
Sound returned first. The swaying of leaves as a cool breeze passed through. The constant pitter patter of rain as it fell from the sky, forming small puddles below.

Smell was the next to return. The soft green of the grass below. Nature in its full breath, an unusual scent for one who grew up in the city.




## Forsaken

Constraints:
Mute (Lost his voice to sickness)
Lost touch, voice, taste.

Will lose:
Sight, smell

Last moments
Lose all 5 senses.

Uses “demon arts” (spirit arts) to talk, every time he uses demon arts, his lifespan reduces.

Demon - a creature born from darkness


Initial mission: encounters a spirit lord, Pandora’s Vessel (Witch).

Forsaken
A group of people abandoned by the world, doomed to a certain death. They have come to also be known as Pandora’s Chosen. Those marked by Pandora will eventually be reclaimed by her, their sanity eroded and their form subverted into that of a monster. The only way to escape her grasp is to die before the mark is activated.

They are greatly feared by the general populace because it is never known then their curse will erupt, turning them into a bloodthirsty monster.

Forsaken gain the ability to use “demon arts,” special abilities that put them above the general populace. Each use of demon arts brings them closer to death, or the curses violent eruption.

Organization: Fractal
A gathering of “demon arts practitioners,” or the Forsaken. The ultimate goal is to investigate and cure the Forsaken.

Organization: Nightfall
Born form the collapse of Fractal, an extremist group that desires the end of the world (to reach the eternal night). A gathering of “demon arts practitioners,” with some religious connotation around the end of the world. The only way to reach “Pandora” is through the world’s end or death. The ones marked by Pandora are called Forsaken, abandoned by the world and doomed to a certain death. Saint’s of the Forsaken are called “Witches” and wield immense powers.

Witches’ Blessing, Pandora’s chosen, Pandora’s mark, Devil’s Flower, The black flower (spoken for the flower like pattern that the mark takes).

Witches
Pandora’s vessels, those that have completely surrendered to pandora and are incarnations of all the world’s evils. The organization Fractal is their archnemesis, as they seek to cure the disease, thus weakening Pandora’s power.


Pandora
A false entity born from all the resentment of the fallen Forsaken who had their life cut short. Desires the destruction of the world and can send messages to her seven sins(witches).

#### July 10th, 2019

Okay, so I just want to write a fun story. How do I go about that? Ignore everything else, I want to write a story where the main character has fun. Perhaps because that is the focus of the story, he gets caught up with some unusual characters.

Found a dungeon core and everyone else wants a piece of it? Everyone has a core and racing to get first?

Demon - Raine Vesper / Snow White
Fallen - Fel (Felicia)
Dark Elf -

Kinda want to write the everdistant horizon original version, where black box/pandora's box and the search for being able to draw forth the holy sword to save the world.

Actually, perhaps it isn't too hard to save the world, but it is impossible to save Pandora who is trapped in the cube. Each version of MC must make a choice to save the world, fail and be swallowed by Pandora, or save Pandora and take the extreme hard mode route.

Only way to save the world is to draw the holy sword?

Idea \#2, that I am kinda leaning towards:
White card falls from the heavens and allows the main character to join the academy of magic. Well, to take the entrance exam towards the academy.

Let's see. Looking back at my original motivation to writing Alter Trigger, Limit Break, and Sorrow's End, well not really Sorrow's End, but the other few that I really enjoyed. I want the main character to do something absolutely incredible in his female form and become famous for it?

The question is how to go about that. I abandoned Limit Break because of the issue that once the main character became a ranker, none of his friends ever had any shot of matching up to his potential.

I do not want a character that leaves everyone else behind and has unsurpassed potential. The issue with freely switching between forms is that there is the possibility that one form (male) becomes completely redundant after a period of time. If the main character is friends with everyone as female self, will male self ever get any screen time? Is it even worth writing about his male self if the female self is the only thing that is important?

Alter Trigger had an interesting take on that in that the male self eventually disappeared.

I guess the issue is that it is hard to write about switching in between forms without some kind of gimmick like superpowers. So now that I have said that, is there anything that comes to mind?

...Nope.

Another issue with limit break is a fight will only have tension of limit break is used every fight. I want to avoid that.


#### July 2nd, 2019

I want to write something like snow white order where the main character finds himself in the middle of a warzone and panics, having no idea what is going on. It is only because there is a more experienced person with them that he survives.

Perhaps tries to figure out self and sudden changes while panicking? But for some reason, I don't want to do it with exiting stories in my mind. Eleventh hour could work but that seems more like a slice of life style story, rather than the initial panic.

Star Magic? Well, if I start it with the first dream, then that might work but that falls into the same problem of not wanting to write a series that focuses heavily on things that do not happen in the real world. Infinite Horizon could work but the setup would have to be readjusted.

I like the idea of instance dungeon areas that people can go to to battle or whatever. Both Eleventh Hour and infinite horizon implement this idea. But I dunno.

Artificial Spirit? It does fit, but at the same time it doesn't. Hmm, part of the idea is that I like that Snow White Order, the main character knows what is going on but has no idea what they are doing in that particular scenario. Also, they recognize the person that is helping them but never knew them personally. They are also completely scared out of their mind and desperation fuels all of their actions.

Could a story with such desperation and survival live in the long run? That is the issue I have with most "survival" stories is that once we get passed the initial survival mode, then it immediately gets boring. Hmm... will have to think about it but in the meantime, I will have to get back to work. Nevermind, still have 5 more minutes.

Did I come up with anything out of this? Not really. Well, it was nice to sit down and type something, even if that did not translate to a story itself.

My ideas for the main character: Succubus, Cursed Child, Magical Girl, Homunculus, Hero, game character turned real, Transformed by holy sword, Witch(Snow White/A Certain Heretical Witch), Invaded by curses/the world, waking up in siblings body(Everdistant Horizon), Pandora's Box(Original Everdistant). Lets get this into a bulleted list.

- Succubus
- Cursed child
- Magical girl
- Homunculus
- Hero
- game character
- Witch
- Pandora's box
- Possessing sibling

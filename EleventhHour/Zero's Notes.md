Time to dump my thoughts here while I wait for this to go forward.

Raine frolics in the rain because she is so happy to be alive.

Perhaps when in male form, calls himself Phi? Would make an interesting case with Zero, One, and Phi.

Well, it might also be a signal to Snow White that he is somehow related to Delta, who has passed away.

First one introduced is Snow White. Then Fel. Then Dark Elf who I do not have a name for yet, Kanaria? Perhaps elves are famous for their voices and can sing to the trees... except Kanaria, who has a beautiful voice but has no magic within her voice.

Perhaps it might be best to make a list here.

Phi / Raine Vesper
- Cursed Demon
- Fallen Angel
- Dark Elf
- Pandora

Zero / Pandora

One (Original 1.0)
- Demon
- Angel
- Elf
- Zero

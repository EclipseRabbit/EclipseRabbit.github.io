## Chapter Zero

Rain fell endlessly from the sky. The sun hid behind the clouds, as if abandoning those below. Houses towered over the fallen boy, orderly like silent gravestones.

Cold. It was really too cold. Warmth abandoned the boy, spilling freely from the gaping hole in him.

Was this really how it was going to end, the boy could not help but wonder.

Was his life going to end so abruptly?

As his consciousness grew distant, a change overcame the world. It took his blurry consciousness a moment to realize the change.

"...?"

The rain had stopped. No, that was wrong. The rain had not stopped. The rain was frozen in midair. It was not just the rain. The entire world had halted, as if frozen in time.

The shadows pooled together and a woman appeared above the fallen boy.

"And so yet another one of us meets their end..."

The woman's voice was flat, yet her eyes held an unmistakable helplessness within them.

"We ask of thee, do you wish to live?"

A solemn proclamation, a solemn question. The boy had but only one answer to give.

"I..."

His throat would not cooperate. Even so, with his fading strength, he forced out the words.

"...want to live!"

"You can not be saved. Your future is shrouded in darkness. All paths forward end rather abruptly. Even so, to fulfill that meager wish of yours, are you willing to open Pandora's Box?"

A black box that swallowed all the surrounding light appeared above the woman's hand and floated down to the boy. With no hesitation the boy reached out and grabbed the box.

Immediately, warmth surged through his veins. The gaping hole inside of him disappeared, and he was made whole again.

"Cinderella's magic ended at midnight. So too shall yours. May you fulfill our wish and overcome destiny itself."

With heat inside the boy's body overflowed and his vision went white. The last thing he saw before his consciousness completely faded was the single look of sorrow on the woman's face.

Sound returned first. The swaying of leaves as a breeze passed through. The constant pitter patter of rain as it fell from the sky, forming small puddles below.

Smell was the next to return. The soft green of the grass below. Nature in its full breath, an unusual scent for one who grew up in the city.

The soft texture of the grass underneath. The occasional raindrop that made it through the tree and rolled off of his face.

The boy opened his eyes. He was no longer dying in the middle of the street. Instead, he found himself in a park on a small hill under the tree. The only constant between the two situations was that it was still raining, meaning he was probably still in the same city.

Rain... Remembering how all the raindrops had frozen in midair when he was talking to that girl, he could not help but pinch himself. Everything felt like a dream to him. Yet, even in this dream, several warning signs were firing off in his mind.

Everything felt... different. The world had more color, everything was clearer, and warmth flowed freely throughout his body. The boy absent mindedly reached up to pinch himself. Pain ran through his cheeks. It wasn't a dream. Even so...

"Were my cheeks always this soft..?"

A voice that chimed like a bell that he did not recognize spoke up at the same time, with the same words as him. No, that wasn't right...

Thinking of all the odd sensations he felt since waking up, the boy scrambled over to the small puddle at the base of the tree. Even though the occasional droplets caused ripples in the puddle, he could still make out his reflection on the surface.

He... no, she started in mute shock. Her savior's words echoed through her head.

"Cinderella's magic ended at midnight..."

The girl repeated the word's that the black-haired woman had told her. She had not understood their meaning until now, but staring at her reflection brought forward a new sense of clarity. The girt in the reflection had long blue hair that spilled down to her waist. One eye was sky blue. The other was gold with a clock inlaid on it, pointing at 1 o'clock. A clock within her eye...

"Midnight..?"

What would happen when midnight came around? If the magic that saved her life wore off, would she die? A shiver went down the blue-haired girl's spine as she thought of dying a second time.

...There just was not enough time to do everything she wanted to do if that was the case.

The black-haired girl had given her something that she had called Pandora's Box. If the box belonged to her savior, then that meant her name was...

"Pandora."

An odd feeling filled her. The magic that had saved her was called Pandora's box. If one took both the myth and Pandora's words into account, then that meant endless despair awaited her.

"No... that is not right."

In the myth, Pandora opening the box brought despair to the entire world and yet, hope was hidden at the very bottom. Was there a deeper meaning hidden in Pandora's words?

The girl shook her head to clear the gloomy thoughts and examined herself.

If she squinted just right, she could see a passing resemblance between herself and Pandora.

The sound of footsteps through the growing puddles brought the girl out of her introspection. Looking towards the sound, the girl who had hair the color of sky saw another girl in her school's uniform walking through the empty park.

At the same time, the girl with snow white hair saw her as well.

"Have you seen a pink haired"

----







Just a little practice.

"Hahaha, I am alive!"

The girl rose to her feet in excitement. Her body was filled with warmth. She rushed out from the undenreath the tree into the pouring rain in front of her.

Compared to the cold, nothingness that threatened to swallow her before, it was liek she was in a completely different world now. A big grin stretched across the girl's face as she twirled around and laughed in the rain.

"Hahaha!"

Her blue hair sailed freely in the sky. The falling rain cleansed away all her fears and she had never felt more alive than in this moment. Warmth rushed through her and the girl's could not contain the sudden rush of energy and life.

Even when her clothes got soaked and her hair became damp, the girl's smile only became brighter. The pitter patter of the rain. The gentle breeze that swayed the leaves in the tree. The soft green grass below and the fresh scent of nature

Every part of it spoke to her about her miraculous recovery from death. She could not be happier.

The girl lost track of time as she played freely in the rain.  Time seemed to slow down as she played freely in the rain. Perhaps because of the rain, she was the only one in the park.

The girl lost herself in her own little corner of paradise, forgetting about the possibility of other's watching.

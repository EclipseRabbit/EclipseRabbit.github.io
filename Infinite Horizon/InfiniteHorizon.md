### Zero
#### Chapter 00:


It hurts.

Alienation. The world collapsed around her. Fear. A dark abyss swallowed her whole. Rejection. Even then, her sister’s words echoed endlessly in her heart.

“Sorry brother, we didn’t think you would actually do it. Mother and Father will not be joining us.”

Countless plans lay abandoned by the wayside. Raine no longer knew which direction she was heading.

“I know one of my conditions was to delete your previous avatar and create a girl character, but you actually did it?”

He had set aside his future prospects for them and they couldn’t care less.

It hurts, the child repeated to herself.

It was not their fault that his family did not understand. They had raised impossible tasks just so they could force him away but his desire to share this world with them was much greater than they expected.

To put the soul of one being in the body of something so drastically different was not without its own consequences. That was why most players created avatar’s in their own image.

It was originally only on the level of discomfort, something that could be gotten used to after a time. However, Raine’s reunion with her sister pushed her over the metaphorical edge.

It hurts.

Her feet wandered aimlessly in the darkness. She had already lost everything. Perhaps this was the time when she gave in and disconnected from this false reality, yet Raine stubbornly continued forward.

If she gave up, she would only be proving them right. Even when the world was shrouded in darkness and the false became real, Raine continued her journey.

It… hurts?

There were limitations put into place that such a thing should not be possible. A wet liquid rolled down Raine’s cheeks, dropping into the abyss below.

A small ripple spread throughout the entire abyss.

Raine’s eyelids grew heavy. With each step, warmth seeped away from her body. With each step, ripples traveled throughout the abyss. Exhaustion filled her limbs as reach of her senses grew ever so distant.

The pain went away, replaced by a bone-chilling cold. Raine intuitively knew she would not last long in this state, yet she no longer had the strength to open her eyes.

It’s cold, the lost child muttered to herself.

In the cold abyss, there was a small candle light. Compared to the darkness around it, it stood out like a brilliant conflagration. Chasing after that elusive light, Raine’s footsteps gained a new sense of purpose.

Step by step, she shook off the chains of exhaustion that sought to entrap her. The abyss hovered ominously behind her, waiting for a single slip up. Step by step, Raine drew closer to that precious warmth she sought.

She didn’t notice when the ground became a soft grass. Nor did she realize that her surroundings had become noisy.

Seeing that once everdistant warmth so near, Raine reached out..

...and embraced it.

Bone chilling ice melted away under the surrounding warmth.  Raine’s journey ended and she entrusted herself to that protective warmth. A sudden sense of weightlessness filled her fading thoughts.

Even so, a small smile flitted across her face.

Raine fell asleep under the soft embrace of that warm flame.

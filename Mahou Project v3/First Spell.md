- Quantum time lock (magical transformation scene)
- Alternate space (where clothes are stored)
- Master's the ability to transform (using time and space) because doesn't want to treat others to a strip show, perhaps the only thing that he works on before getting into a fight.


- Outline
- Sion wakes up confused as a magical girl
- Mother informs him that he isn't just a girl, but a magical girl
- Kicks him out of the house, remarks to his father that the first day of a magical girl is important because it determines their path
- Sion ends up going to the anime convention that he had bought a ticket for
- Meets Devil(that is a magical girl fan, dressed up as a magical girl. basically Serafall)
- Starts getting into a serious discussion with Serafall about magical girls, hangs out with her
- Starts discussing the mechanics of magical girls, mainly focusing on transformation and where their clothes go
- Flying is briefly brought up, but it is a given that magical girls can fly
- Goes home and uses newfound knowledge to end the transformation, botching it up.
- Next day, goes to school(?). there is a person at the school who is desparate for someone to listen to him but no one will give him the time. MC doesn't believe him, but transforms into a magical girl and magical girl self does. This is what pulls him into the other side of the world.



- Magical girl's basically operate on imagination
- Because Sion doesn't know any other real magical girl's, he blasts through a few walls all on his own without realizing it.
- For example, when he first turns back, he imagines a time lock in an alternate space (in his heart/mind), an extremely advanced spell that is impossible for beginners.
- Of course, he doesn't truly manage it, but that is the image his transformation takes which is the core of his repetoire
- Trigger image, such as rush of warmth, pulling a trigger, surge of love, whatevs.
- In this sense, he is a failure of a magical girl since his image is around sealing/unleashing time/space, rather than friendship/love/peace/hope.

- Because of his image of wave/particle duality, and because he chooses to accept both selves (magical and real), he ends up creating what he calls a "Quantum Time Lock," both states exist simultaneously while there is not an observer to see it.
- Alas, because of his "Quantum Time Lock," his body gets stuck in a state that is not quite a magical girl but not his normal state either.
- Since he has no teacher, anime must be his guide. He doesn't know what is impossible so he can only try something on his own.
- Modern magician's/magical girl's use calculations to perform all their spells since it is easily reproducable and can be shared with others.
- In that sense, MC becomes an "Ancient" magical girl who relied on their own belief/world to create spells
- Very powerful, very rare, and also very subject to the user's state of mind.
- Modern magic is very easy to reproduce when compared to Ancient magic... there is no inheritance for ancient magic like modern magic

- During time stop, all movements cost stamina? First time using time stop and moving, collapses on the ground and can't move due to muscle pain?

## Lightning / Zero Personality:
Perhaps like this: Stoic exterior with an impassive face hides the energetic and curiosity within.

Transforming into a magical girl strips all the layers of protection off of him, leaving himself more vulnerable, and the childish and energetic self that had long been buried emerged within.

In a sense, you can say that the "true self" is the one that is a magical girl while  the "false self" presented to the world is his normal self.

False Self / Lightning:
Independent. Doesn't come to others for help often. Face is fairly impassive and does not interact much with others. Heart is closed off. Doesn't speak much. Buries childish delight under apathy / walls of fear. Very sensitive to other's opinion's and does best to not stand out.

True Self / Zero:
Very much needs the help of others. Is bright and energetic, looks at the world with childish delight. Naturally curious and tries to understand the situation. Face is very expressive. "Defenseless". Naturally reveals thoughts on face. Becoming a magical girl stripped the barrier's in her heart. Fighting is literally displaying one's inner heart for all to see. That is part of what makes her magic so captivating and what makes "Magical Girl's" so special. Magical girls that deny themselves and their true feelings can never reach their full potential.

Because wearing heart on one's sleeve, becomes better at reading others and more sensitive to their thoughts/feelings/behavior.

Because of the bleed over effect, Zero's personality starts to bleed over to Lightning and Lightning becomes more expressive.

"When was the last time that child came to us for help?"
"Was my face always this expressive?"

### The first spell

When he woke up that morning, he had become a magical girl.

Sion Lightgard, a proud member of the long line of Lightgard family, did not know what to do with him... herself at that moment.

Gone was his short blonde hair. In its place, long pink hair spilled to her waist. His eyes, once remeniscent of the setting sun, were now clear eyes the color of the bright blue sky outside. And of course, his prided Lil Excalibur that had yet to be unsheathed...

"Gone..!"

A bright voice chimed like a bell through the bedroom. The girl's face turned pale as the horror of the situation hit her in full.

"It's... gone!"

The girl repeated in utter horror, her hands tightly clenching the bedsheets. Her world had gone crashing down on her and she could only repeat herself dumbly in utter shock.

----

The magical girl left the house, leaving only the two parents behind.

"When was the last time that child came to us for help?"

The Mother asked to the Father.

# Zero
True appearance is that of Pandora's child. White hair with red eyes. Covers that up with the despair of the world collected by Excalibur Morgan.

# Combat Style
- Magic: Void/gravity/singularity.
- Summon darkness of the world to create monsters and attack
- Create weapons outs of darkness
- Shoot weapons out of void at enemies.

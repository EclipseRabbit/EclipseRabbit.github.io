Chapter 1.

Sion wakes up as a magical girl.
Discusses with parents.
Parents are happy to be relied on.
Sion goes to an anime convention.
Meets another cosplaying magical girl.
Discusses the mechanics of magical girls.
Talks about how the transformation scene is use of time magic/slowing down time.
Talks about how the clothes come from and are stored in an alternate space.
Talks about how flight is achieved through the manipulation of gravity.

These (impossible) feats are achieved through ignorance and the power of the world's darkness.

Instead of a happy go lucky magical girl, perhaps darkness itself?

After meeting with Serafall at the magic convention, heads home and arrives to an empty house.

In the middle of the living room, a sword is planted into the ground.

Goes to pick up the sword and as soon as hand reaches the sword's handle, clapping echoes throughout the room.

Lightning looks for the perpetrator and a fallen angel reveals himself.

Lightning questions where her parents are and the fallen says he killed them.

Fallen displays a paper, saying it is their last words to her, before burning it up to pieces.

Fallen laughs as darkness claims Lightning from the sword.

Mentions how the magical girl transformation was a reaction to approaching danger, and that the sword was in danger.

Bloodline of Drakengard/Lightgard used the dormant magical girl power's to awaken to fight the encroaching darkenss, but too late.

Despair of Lightning resonates with the Excalibur fragment and plunges the sword into darkness.

Despair/Nightfall consumes Lightning, making the magical girl fall into darkness and become a "witch".

Fallen angel proclaims this the birth of the world's Witch of Calamity, Pandora.

While falling into darkness, Lightning's mind goes to that one kernel of hope. Fragment/remainder of Sword of Hope/Excalibur shows Lightning the words on the piece of paper that his parents left for him.

As the word's play through his mind, he realizes the true situation. Drakengard family is in charge of protecting the holy blades from falling into darkness. It is his parent's final wish for him and his wrath/anger/despair refuses to let the fallen win.

While fallen is gloating from the victory, Pandora uses new found knowledge theory from magical girl's and stabs him in the heart (using time stop). Quantum Time Lock on the last fragment of hope in his heart? While creating this time lock, stops time and pulls out the sword and stabs the fallen.

Because of the strength of despair, what is normally impossible (timestop, cage of time), gets shrugged off under the power of all the world's evils. Black hair red and gold eyes.

After fallen angel dies, Pandora inverts the time lock, releases the transformation, and cages the despair in her heart with alternate space/time/gravity/black hole (Quantum Time Lock).

Pink haired (magical girl) Lightning is gone. With the rain falling through the holes in the roof, black inky darkness gets washed away from Pandora, leaving only a blue haired (weak) (all power's restrained) magical girl (who appears purely human/unrelated to the magical world) Raine Vesper.

A local devil arrives nearby and offers Raine a shelter and a place to go to school. Raine is the very weak hope inside of Pandora, the hope buried underneath all the darkness. It is also the refusal to lose to the fallen and the will to carry out the duty entrusted to her. That duty to protect the sword, and the hope that her parents aren't actually dead, is all that is keeping Raine going at this point.

End of Chapter 1.

Chapter ??

Pandora fights every night when she goes to sleep against all the world's evils, the Sword of Hope (Excalibur) that has now turned into a Sword of Despair (Nightfall).

Eventually the battle becomes too much for her and she remembers the magical girl Serafall's words to believe in her friends.
Left with no choice, she appears as Pandora in front of her friends and summons some inner/heart demon's from her heart/world/mind, and has them defeat them. By offloading demon's into the real world, she ease the burden on the alternate self that is fighting against despair.

If her friends can overcome the strengths of the demon's within her heart, then she will hand over the sword that has fallen to despair, Nightfall.

Perhaps she tries approaching multiple people under the guise of Pandora, attacking anyone who might be worthy to hold/purify Excalibur of Despair.

Lightgard family sends over their own people.

Chapter ???

Lets see if I can make this like Fate Infinity Shuffle... Cards to represent latent potential? Perhaps their are different types of cards. Higher beings such as devil's and angel's can fill cards with power and give it to people below them. Maybe these power's are called "Aspects"

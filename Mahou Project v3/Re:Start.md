## Minus One

Drip. Drip. Drip.

It was a fragment of the strongest holy sword, the culmination of the hope of man. She was a magical girl, a symbol of love and peace. And yet...

Drip. Drip. Drip.

A haze of white filled Light's world. Disjointed thoughts came and withered away. What had happened..?

She had instinctively recognized the sword as soon as she saw it. It was the sword of hope, the sword that crowned the one true king, the most famous sword in the world... Excalibur.

Her eyes traced the sword from the hilt down the blade. Pain radiated throughout her body when Light gasped in surprise.

Stabbed into her chest was that very blade she once worshipped.

"Amusing isn't it? Being killed by the very blade your family swore to protect?"

A dark voice cut through the fog obscuring Light's vision. Her eyes focused on the man with black wings sticking out of his back.

"Did you not question why you suddenly changed?"

Yes, despite being stabbed by a fragment of the strongest holy sword, Light hadn't died yet. In fact, she had not gone by the name Light at all. When Light had woken up this morning, her body had changed into her present appearance. Her pajamas had disappeared and in their place was this pink, frilly outfit.

"Pfft. I still can't believe it worked. Snow Lightgard, you transformed into a magical girl because of the danger approaching you. Despite originally being a guy."

Light's vision flared white from the revelation. It was this guy's fault that she became a magical girl..?

"Your family's duty is to protect the Excalibur fragments. So when your body sensed one nearby that was in danger, it reacted and turned you into a magical girl."

The man with black wings grinned, as if everything was in the palm of his hands. Light opened her mouth to speak but nothing came out. Even now, her life's blood slowly fell away.

Drip. Drip. Drip.

A pool of blood had formed at her feet.

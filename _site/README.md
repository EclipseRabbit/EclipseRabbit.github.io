This is a place for a simple rabbit to muddle around with both coding a javascript project as well as writing a story in its free time. Don't expect much and as everyone knows, a rabbit is likely to fall asleep halfway through the race.

Restraints:

Abyssal Regalia - Responsible for turning Raine’s appearance into a child. Serves as a barrier between Raine and the outside world. Makes it difficult to perform magic outside one’s body. Sometimes used for training in the Academy. Reduced mana regeneration. Higher mana density. Mana is typically gaseous, condenses it down to a liquid? Raises quality/purity of mana itself.

No crystal - Can only use natural calculation space and frame/body is very small. Do not have enough points to hold many skills. (Rank C is the first time the space is big enough to store the flight spell).

Child Female form - Every difference between real body and virtual body reduces the syncro rate. Low syncro rates cause everything to feel distant, reduced sense of touch, can result in dizziness and nausea. Body feels heavier and it is more difficult to make delicate movements. Can result in blacking out or disconnecting from the game. Gets tired/fatigued quickly. Only reason Raine can withstand low synchro is the side effect of the Abyssal Regalia, which anchors her spirit/soul to the unfamiliar body.

Demands family made of Raine before they would join the game:
Delete his main account (parents)
Play as a female character (sister)

Since playing the game is his livelihood, they raised impossible demands, not expecting Raine to actually do it. If he actually does it, he crushes his livelihood. If he doesn’t do it, then shows he has no intention of making up with them.

In a sense, Raine was actually more comfortable (mentally) in the child form than adult form, which is why he put the collar on. Because he knows the difference between his skills and a newbie, he layers several restraints on himself so that they can enjoy playing the game together(He doesn’t breeze through it by himself, carrying the other).

His idea(perma Novice) is not something that hasn’t been done before and he is not the first person to tread this path. But he is the first person to use Abyssal Regalia + Novice class

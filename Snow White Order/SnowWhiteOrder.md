# Chapter Zero: Flame Covered City: Fuyuki Singularity F

Flames, burning and consuming anything and everything.

The smell of burning flesh, the hideous screaming. Every time I breathed, my insides hurt horribly.

With every step I took, I left a little piece of me behind.

Tears rolled down my face, evaporating before ever reaching the ground.

Howling laughter filled the air, creating a cacophony with the crackling fire. It took me a moment to realize that the laughter came from my mouth.

Was this the result of my wish? The deepest desires that I hid deep within my heart?

Contempt and despair filled my heart. The flames licked it all up.

I was going to die. Pure white filled my mind at the thought. My head throbbed in pain and a burning pain erupted on the back of my hand.

There was no hope.

The ruined city around me could atest to that. There was not a person in sight. Buildings were afire. The city was in a state of total collapse.

There are no miracles.

I was going to die.

The future was shrouded in darkness.

The dark sky above had not a hint of light in it. My strength failed me and I finally collapsed to the ground. I put my hands underneath me and pushed, but I did not have the strength to rise again.

It was all too easy to give up. I had done so all my life. This was merely the last time I would be able to do so. Rolling over, I looked up at the smoky sky.

Damn. Not a single ray of light in sight. The familiar blue sky had been replaced by an inky darkness.

I didn't want to let it end.

I lifted my arm to cover my eyes. Even so, bitter tears escaped down my face.

I didn't want to let it end.

But the harsh reality closed in on me. The flames drew closer. Despite their close proximity, my body grew cold. My strength faded with each passing second.

I didn't want to let it end, so in a last futile effort...

My mind went over all the things I had left undone, all the dreams that were left unaccomplished. Crying out from the depths of my heart, I lifted a hand to the sky.

"Someone..."

A weak voice I barely recognized as my own reached my ears. Unfortunately, I didn't have the strength to finish the last part.

...Help me.

As my vision went dark, something reached out and grabbed my outstretched hand.

"%$#$#@$"

## ---------- ##

I fully expected to never wake again which is why it came as a surprise when I opened my eyes to see a red-haired boy staring at me.

"W-Where am I?"

Those were the first thoughts that came to mind. I couldn't quite remember what had happened previously. Fortunately for me, the boy spoke up quickly.

"Fuyuki, or at least a place that closely resembles Fuyuki several years ago."

"Fuyuki?"

I repeated the familiar word, staring blankly at the boy in front of me. Perhaps he noticed my gaze, because the boy smiled and spoke up.

"Ah, I am Emiya Shirou."

Emiya Shirou. White hot pain laced through my head, causing me to clutch my head.

"You are..."

I muttered in disbelief. At the last second, I changed what I was going to say.

"...Kiritsugu's son?"

Shirou's face closed up and his eyes became guarded.

"How did you know dad?"

I winced. I had zero confidence in my ability to lie, not to mention how much uncomfortable I felt whenever I deceived someone.

"I knew of him, but I never actually met him."

Shirou grimaced, but his eyes did not lose their guarded look. I imagine he had heard from many people what they thought of Kiritsugu, but few of them probably could connect the man to Shirou just from hearing his name.

"What were you doing out in the streets while the city was on fire?"

Shirou questioned.

"I don't remember."

I was not even lying. Perhaps I once knew how I got on the streets of the flaming Fuyuki, but I couldn't remember at the moment. I grimaced as white hot stabs of pain shot through my temple whenever I tried to force myself to remember. Perhaps that memory had forever been lost during my hazy walk through the streets.

"How long was I out?"

I asked curiously. Looking around the room, there was no way to tell the passage of time. Even outside the windows, the sky was just as dark as before. The room appeared to be a small one bedroom apartment. I was laying down in the bed and Shirou was sitting by the bedside.

"It has only been two hours."

"Only two hours?"

I stared at the Faker in disbelief. Shirou scratched his cheek sheepishly, losing his guarded look for the first time since I brought up Kiritsugu's name.

"Yeah. You were in surprisingly good shape."

I didn't believe him for a second. I knew better than anyone just how close I was to dying. He must have used his trump card to restore me to this condition so quickly.

"Thanks for saving me."

I needed to say it. I was unsure how often the selfless hero like him heard words of gratitude. He didn't do it to be thanked, but I wanted to show him some form of appreciation.

"Your welcome."

Shirou averted his eyes. A small smile graced his face. After a moment he regained his calm and spoke up with a hint of concern.

"Do you feel anything strange or different about your body."

"Lets see..."

I lifted myself from the bed. For some reason, Shirou hastily averted his eyes. Reaching behind his back, he pulled out a small shortsword and handed it to me.

Taking it curiously, I stared at myself in the reflection of the blade.

"Huh..?"

I muttered dumbfounded. Only now did I realize there was something odd with my voice when confronted with the impossibility in the blade's reflection. I expected my face to be different on some level due to the amount of burns I must have suffered from, but this...

A girl stared back at me through the reflection of the blade. I looked down at the blanket that barely covered my chest. Sure enough, there were two lumps of fat that were not their previously.

"A girl?"

The words escaped my mouth before I could ponder them. The girl had snow white hair and bright sky blue eyes. Everything about her was different from the previous me and yet, I could not say that she was entirely unfamiliar.

Through each part of her face, I saw a hint of my mother and sister. Needless to say, the girl in the mirror was much appeared younger than the both of them now.

"You mean you weren't a girl previously?"

Shirou had returned to looking at me after hearing my statement. Tugging the blanket cover more of my skin, I eyed him warily. His voice seem remarkably unsurprised.

"Hey Shirou... why did you ask me if anything seemed different?"

After all, there was no way he would know about my sudden change in appearance unless he had some reason to expect it. Shirou seemed remarkably unsurprised that something had changed about me.

I had initially thought he was just worried about my health, but there might be more to this than I initially thought. In the first place, just which Emiya Shirou was this?

I was almost dead. Would an inexperienced Emiya Shirou really be able to heal me back from such a state? I didn't believe it.

"Shirou, why did you flinch when I mentioned about becoming a teenager?"

Seeing my gaze, Shirou raised his hands in surrender.

"You got me. I am actually much older than I appear. When I woke up on these streets, I was a teenager again for some reason."

"And that is why you wanted to know if the same had happened to me?"

I concluded easily. Seeing no reason to hide it, I answered my own question.

"Well, you guessed correctly. Besides suddenly being a different gender, I was previously an adult. Now I appear to be a teenager."

"I see."

The knowledge didn't bring much comfort. We couldn't do anything about it anyways. Glancing around the room, I noticed the lack familiar items, namely...

"Did any of my possessions survive?"

"No, you clothes were in rags so I threw them out. Anything inside your pockets had long since been destroyed by the fire."

"...I see."

There was nothing left of home here except what familiarity I could find in my face. Noticing my falling mood, Shirou rose and went towards the kitchen.

"How about I whip something together while you get changed. There should be clothes in the closet that you can change into."

Agreeing with the red-headed cook, I wrapped the blanket around me and trudged into the closet, carrying the shortsword that Shirou had given with me. Unfortunately, the electricity appeared to be out so I had no choice but to leave the door open and fumble around in the dark.

This apartment obviously belonged to a woman because I saw several bras strung around the floor.

I took a peek behind me. Shirou was still in the kitchen cooking. Feeling  safer, I reached out towards the nearest garment and put it on.

"Fuyuki, huh?"

I spoke out loud to Shirou to take my mind off how uncomfortable I currently was, feeling like a stranger in my own skin. Shirou called from the kitchen.

"When was the last time you found yourself in Fuyuki?"

"It was... huh?"

Shirou's voice suddenly cut off. Hearing him shuffle around, I moved back to the closet. Groping around, I found a few skirts that I quickly discarded. Finally, my hand landed on a white button down dress shirt.

I could hear the sound of a blade hitting wood, probably Shirou cutting some food in the kitchen.

"Its... No way!"

Shirou gasped in surprise. Before I had time to find a pair of pants, Shirou barged into the closet.

"We have to go!"

I had just grasped the shortsword when Shirou pulled me into the main room. The front door burst down and skeletons flooded the room.


"We are leaving!"

"Wait!"

I cried out. I was wearing only a partially buttoned white shirt and a pair of black panties.

"There is no time."

Shirou threw the kitchen knife he was holding at the window, causing the glass to shatter outside. My world suddenly shifted as I found myself in Shirou's arms as he jumped out the broken window and down two stories to the ground below.

"Tch!"

My heart dropped as Shirou let me down. We were surrounded on all sides by skeleton warriors. I gripped the shortsword so tightly that the white of my knuckles showed. Fear threatened to overwhelm me, but then I heard a familiar voice besides me.

"Trace, on!"

## --------------- ##

A pair of black and white swords's shot out, cutting swathes of skeletons to pieces. I did not have time to admire it though as the skeleton's took that as a signal to swarm us.

A skeleton holding a blade charged at me. Seeing death loom ever closer, I raised my shortsword in response. I didn't have time to ponder my action.

Before I could consider what to do, the blade slashed at me. There was no time to dodge. My own sword lashed out in a desperate strike.

A sharp impact ran throughout my arm. A loud clang deafened my ears. I would have dropped my sword if it wasn't for the fact that it was glued to my hand.

Pushing with all my strength, I knocked the skeleton off balance. I moved to capitalize on the opening.

My heart caught in my throat and I leaped backwards.

A spear pierce the ground I was just standing on. I intruder was another skeleton. Cold sweat broke out on my back. That was right, we were surrounded.

My breathing refused to come under control. My feet spread out in an effort to be ready to react to a sudden movement in any direction.

Behind me, a literal whirlwind of destruction was occurring, occupying over 90% of the skeletons. Then, what I had to do was obvious. I only needed to survive.



----------------

The skeleton raised his blade. My mind went pure white. I stared dumbly as the blade flashed down at me, not even thinking to close my eyes and brace myself for the pain.

...

"Huh?"

There was no pain. I was still alive. Regaining control of myself, I saw a white blade buried in the ground in front of me.

Oh. I was saved again.

Despite the skeleton's demise, more joined in to fill the gap. Clutching the shortsword tightly, I raised it and prepared myself. A spear thrust at me. My own sword lashed out in a desparate strike in response.

A loud metal clang accompanied a strong impact through my arm. The shortsword went flying from my hand and was lost in the crowd of skeleton's. Seeing the skeleton raise his spear preparing to end me, I stumbled backwards.

My hand reached out for anything that could save me.

The spear drew closer. I closed my eyes in fear just as my right hand grasped onto something cool behind me.

Huh?

I opened my eyes in time to see the skeleton fade to particles. I killed it?

Tears of joy ran down my face. I was alive!

"Watch out!"

I reflexively raised the sword in response to Shirou's voice.

A sharp impact ran from the blade through my arm. My world spun. I crashed into a hard bony object. Looking around, my heart dropped. The skeletons had taken advantage of my carelessness to surround me.

Before I could despair, the sky rained swords and suddenly a barrier formed between me and the horde.

There was no time.

A bowstring twanged and I threw myself to the ground. A spear descended from the sky. I slashed out with the white blade in my hand.

Another sharp impact. This time, I let go of my weapon on purpose and jumped back. Before the skeleton could recover from its broken stance, I picked up one of the swords impaled in the ground and charged. The skeleton fell in a single, clumsy strike.

A shield suddenly blocked my vision. I barely had time to get the sword in front of me before I was sent flying backwards. My breathe was knocked out of my lungs.

A figure towered over me. There was no way to dodge. A streak of silver went through the air and the skeleton froze as something pierced its shadow. Dashing towards the object, I picked up the black key and slashed the skeleton.

"Damn, there is no end to them."

Before I could think of my next move, my world erupted into pain. A shield. Having disarmed me with its first blow, the skeleton had shield bashed me.

Today, I am going to try to carefully plan out this fight scene that is stumping me.

Shirou and Snow jump down from the building, and get immediately surrounded by a horde of skeletons.

Snow blanks out on the first attack. Her mind can't keep up with the sudden shift to combat and thus, she doesn't react in time.

A thrown Kanshou/Bakuya saves Snow.

Before Snow can make sense of the scene, a blade descends. This time she reacts in time and lashes out with the blade in her hand.

Unprepared for the sharp impact, she loses control of her blade. Showing a big opening, the skeleton shield bashes her into the air and she falls into a horde of skeletons.

Shirou immediately saves the day by creating a rain of swords. Snow takes the chance to look towards Shirou and notes how far he is from her. Shirou cannot save her because he is busy dodging arrows, killing bowman, and fending off the skeletons falling from the sky/aparatment. Even so, Shirou is still fighting his way to her.

The blow to Snow carried her away from the apartment.

Rain of swords forms a protective circle/barrier around her, buying her a moment of piece. A single sword lands in the center of the circle of swords.

Snow clutches her stomach in pain. Tears spill freely from her eyes. Her vision gets watery. She doesn't want to fight. She is afraid. She doesn't want to die.

She knows that she can simply stay in the circle and she is safe. The sword represents a choice.

When Snow grabs the sword and pulls it from the ground, she unconciously activates her magic circuits and a red tattoo is burned on her right hand. Well, the bruise becomes a solid tattoo? Can a master have the command seals before becoming contracted to a Servant? I think so.

Skeleton's begin breaking through the sword barricade one at a time. This gives Snow a chance to fight one on one. The enemy numbers slowly increase until the barrier is fully gone.

Bows twang and she has to throw herself to the ground to avoid them. The archer's can't hit her when she is surrounded by skeletons, they only have a shot once she creates distance so Snow has to carefully maintain her positional awareness of the situation.

Perhaps when Snow grabs the sword, she closes her eyes and her senses shut down one by one. It starts with her feeling vibrations through her feet into her body. The drums of war/battle approaching.


Before snow can catch her breath, a bowstring twangs and Shirou cries out. Snow throws herself to the ground, barely avoiding the arrow.

A giant shadow looms over her. Snow grabs one of the impaled swords and stabs upwards, killing her first enemy.

Snow's mind starts to race and her goal shifts towards survival? She starts using everything she can to survive. Vibrations through her feet, sound, vision.

Because her only weapons are those that Shirou impaled in the ground, she is forced to maintain a situational awareness of where she is in all time and where the nearest sword is.

She still can't fight worth a damn, but she starts to develop a battlefield sense at least among these low level skeletons. That reminds me, the skeletons start laughing at her when she falls down among them. Perhaps the ones mocking her get impaled by the sword rain.

Snow notes Shirou's progress from the sounds of combat. Her heart starts to pound when the regular tempo of combat turns into a crazy race. Shirou yells "GET DOWN!"

Snow absently notes a red streak flying through the air.

Besides her, she hears a "RHO AIS!"

and then her vision turns white. Okay, this seems like a good scene to pick from. The question is how do I transition from two separate fights to a reunion interrupted by Archer?

Snow hears Shirou's progress. She also keeps track of him from the corner of her eyes. Why doesn't Shirou use a bigger projection to wipe them all out at once?

But here is a more important question. Does Shirou and Snow fight together before Archer interupts them? Nah, lets have Shirou shout something that Snow can't make out until its too late. She hears a "GET DOWN" as soon as the red streak appears.

Now how does Snow fend for herself. Perhaps she gets help with the occasional sword showers. Lets go with that. Alright, I have this scene drafted up, all that is left is to write it. Good.


The fight ends when Archer shoots an arrow and Shirou uses Rho Ais. All the skeletons are blown up among the big crater. First question is how to escape the crater? Perhaps Shirou falls unconsious from the recoil?

I thought I knew what was going on.

"Have you ever been here before?"

"No, I grew up in the States and very seldomly traveled abroad."

"But you can speak perfect Japanese."

My eyes widened. Indeed, I had not had any difficulties speaking to Shirou even though I had never learned the language.

"The perks of transmigrating, I guess."

I laughed.

"You aren't from here?"

"Shirou, where do you think we are?"

"Fuyuki."

"What is the current year?"

"Its..."

Shirou trailed off. Maybe he was just now noticing the calendar on the wall.

"That can't be!"

Shirou shouted in surprise.

It was the year 2004, the same year as the Holy Grail War.

"That is right. We have gone back in time. Not only that, but this isn't even our own world anymore."

"Wha-?"

"Singularity F: Flame Covered City Fuyuki. It is the name of the town we currently reside in."

"Singularity..."

Shirou repeated, deep in thought.

"Think of it like an alternate world where any changes we make will be independent of the world's actual history. Something went wrong in this world, bringing about this burning city. Can you think of anything?"

"The Holy Grail War."

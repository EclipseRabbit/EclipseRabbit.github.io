### Rambles v3

Lets see... Snow White x Magician x Hero.

The story starts with Snow getting a new teacher at school? Or perhaps getting thrown in with the troublesome kids of the school? Anyways, the new teacher is like 12 years old. He is also a magician lacking common sense that has graduated from college. He is teaching to compelte his training and become a full fledged magician. Perhaps magician's take knowledge as really important so research and teaching are the too big things for them.

Snow's mentality/backstory.

Born with mental energy unlocked (blue eyes). The world they see is different than everyone else.  Blue eyes are a sign of his mental strength, and they are different from his brother and sister. At a young age, because of his mental strength, he vastly outstrips his siblings. Things he finds easy are difficult for them. His surroundings are distorted and he gets called a monster. Soon, he stops trying and seals his mental strength, striving to be "ordinary". Actually, "ordinary" is not what he truly is looking for.

School came easily to him so he can not take pride in. He feels little value in things he has not earned himself. On contrast, he is delighted when things end up poorly for him. He is lazy and slacker, but he works hard at the things he is bad at, turning him into an all rounder. In fact, he usually ends up better at the things he was originally bad at because he enjoys doing them more. In a sense, he is an all rounder superhuman that hardly ever displays his skills. Once he becomes "good" at something and receives a compliment for it, he usually drops it or loses interest.

In a sense, he enjoys overcoming challenges. Because of this attitutde, he does martial arts frequently because he is bad at them. It is also the one thing his siblings easily surpass him in that he feels like he has no hope of catching up in. His strong mind allows him to grasp martial arts quickly, but it doesn't make his body any stronger. In fact, his body is weaker than average and it is only through his hard work that he reaches an ordinary level.

Mind weakens body, body weakens magic, magic weakens mind. In a sense, Snow is looking for magic as a power to suppress his mind. The only thing he is worse at than martial arts is magic. Perhaps he has an even stronger interest in magic because of how unusual it is to him, who can make the world his plaything. It is an absolutely alien point of view to he who has his own personal reality.

Now... how does he unlock the ability to use Ki and mana? I am thinking he unlocks mana externally through an excalibur fragment? He unlocks Ki by suffering a strong Ki blast and trapping it within his body?

Hmmm....

Lightgard = magic past
Miyamoto = body demon sealing past.

Miayamoto Zero = Void seed. Enter a state of nothingness. Because of Sion's constant training, his mind turns to a void and plants a seed. How does this turn into body refining? Perhaps it takes in the energy of the world that will normally turn a person into demon? Plant 7 seeds to create seven blackholes in the important parts of the body? Then watch them become stars? Or perhaps 1 void/zero and stars are just orbiting it?

Well... idk.

Lightgard is easy. He touches the Sword of Hope Excalibur of Hope fragment and his bloodline causes the sea of information to immediately open it. This also causes the sword to hide in his spirit. He uses the informamtion in the sword as a blueprint, his mind as the canvas, and transforms his body into alternate form? Zero form?

Void/Zero state inside his body hides all of the energy resting in his body/Ki. Life energy. Yeah... it is a black hole... true name world seed. His mind and body are connected to nurture another world.

Lets see... how do I want this to work. Snow works on the Miaymoto art backwards. The final state is to reach zero and unlock the mind but his mind is unlocked from the begining. Instead, he unloks Zero/The world seed. This resides in his mind, but it cuts out all the generated Ki that he has and stores it in its center. perhaps when it is time to transform, it takes all that energy and explodes outwards, causing the "flower to bloom" and the body to transform. No, that might not be right. The black hole/void seed connects the Mind(personal reality) (inner) world to the Body (outer) world.

You could say the world is divided into 2 segments. The inner (mind) world and the outer (magic) world. The body is used to bridge the gap. Yeah, I like that. This is also why in the outer world, magic suppresses mind. This is also what makes mind rare. Much rarer than magicians, who are rarer than body. Body has no innate requirements. In fact, Snow has a small accomplishment in this area through sheer effort. Magic does have requirements though. Soul/Spirit/Knowledge. Coming from an esteemed bloodline like Lightgard has an effect that makes it easier to master magic, making Snow an outlier in this area since his potential to use magic is utterly suppresed by his mind.

Soul sea (informational sea) (informational body) (akashic records)
Mind palace (void palace) (personal reality) (collective unconcious)
Body temple? (body as world). Perhaps Body goes guardian -> hero -> saint -> demigod -> god.

The body is a temple.
The mind is palace.
The soul is a sea.

Lets see... the mind is the branches
The body is the trunk
the soul is the roots?

All together now.

Mind = Thoughts = Present = palace = personal reality = inner world = Branches of the world tree = Heaven
Body = Lifeforce = Future = Vessel that travels from past to present to future = boundary between inner and outer world = trunk = Man
Magic = Soul/Spirit = past = Informational Sea = Records of one's past/memories = Outer world = Earth

Perhaps the state of Zero stands within the body and creates a balance, allowing all three powers to sit in equilibrium. Bringing all three together generates a world seed. Also allows for the conversion of one type of power to another. Creates a hole between inner world and outer world. As a side effect of the hole, Zero can place objects from the (outer) world into the (inner) world/mind.

As the hole/void/zero becomes stronger, the suction becomes greater. As such, Snow needs a stronger power to survive when the "flower blooms".

Yes... I like where this is heading. Because of Zero's unbalanced state, initially unlocking the void threatens to kill him as his body becomes drastically weakened under the strain.

Other affects of void/zero are hidden until a later date. Zero's personal reality becomes everdistant horizon. A hole in the sky (void) and that reflection beneath him (informational sea), You could say it is the between the entrance and exit of the void that connects the inner and outer world. This also draws a line between inner palace and everdistant horizon. great!

Body = Demon = Black hair = Pandora
Magic = Blond hair = Zero/Lightning
Mind = White hair = Snow White/Zero

Starting scene:
* New teacher
* Brother comes by to visit, but doesn't say anything of importance
* Snow is sleeping in the middle of class?
* Snow gets relegated to the problem children class... perhaps this means that he needs to be protected by a special teacher. It is both his and the teacher's first day in the new class. He gets relegated to this new class after his brother comes by to visit? Perhaps for his own protection.

#### Getting Started

Just going to start at a random point then go forward from their. None of this is planed so... oh well.

The dreaded outline:
Snow stares off into the distance, inside the house at the window overlooking the entire town that lives in.

START!!!

The sun dipped over the horizon, dying the entire sky in a mixture of scarlet, vermillion, blue and purple.

It was Snow's favorite hour of the day as the world transitioned from day to night.

Snow sat at the dinner table, gazing out the window idly. There were two mugs at the table, though the one opposite of Snow had long since been empty.

Snow sighed deeply in his heart as he finally confirmed it. He got up from his chair for the first time in an hour and headed deeper into the house.

He stopped briefly at a photo on a chest of drawers and smiled sadly at the family within. It had two happy parents along with their three children.

"Father, Mother..."

Snow silently bid them farewell in his heart and continued on. He knelt down at the shrine and prayed to his parents. Then he purified himself in the traditional manner of his family.

Reaching into the depths of the shrine, he put on the traditional raiments and donned the family sword almost reverently.

By the time he finished, the sun had already set and night overcome day. A full moon hung in the sky, casting the world into a mixture of light and shadows.

It was an unusually clear night with a full moon outside.

##### Characters

MC: Snow (Lightning)
Bro: Leonhardt
Sis: Serafall



Body = Life = Ki/Qi = Guardian / Demon
Spirit = Magic = Mana = Magician
Psyche = Mind = Mental energy/psy = Mystic
Demon / Monster / Beast
Female = Valkyrie
Male =

Okay, so based off of my dream, lets make the main character a triplet with triplet telepathy? He was "born" first so he considers himself the older brother even though that isn't really true.

When his parents run into trouble and their health starts failing, he stays behind to take care of them while his siblings go off to become heroes.

Because of this, he misses the day of awakening/ceremony of awakening and is destined to live the rest of his life as an ordinary person. One could say, he gave up his future so that his brother and sister could continue without worries.

One day, his younger brother who is much stronger than him comes back and wants his help, but never mentions anything overtly. After he leaves, a duo(man and female) in full black with a hood up approach his house with murderous intentions.

Realizing the situation, MC begins preparing for the worst even. Perhaps it is arrogance, perhaps it is pride and perhaps it is a small kindness granted to a dead man, but the two adversaries fully allow the MC to make all of his preparations for the fight. Since he is a "normal", they fully expect the operation to go over like squashing a bug.

Hmm... perhaps the true reason is respect for his bloodline?

MC... lets call him Sion for now, casts a forbidden art and forcibly awakens his potential. Of course, it is a forbidden art so there are drastic consequences.

Forbidden Art: Zero Awakening.

In exchange for extrodinary power, the User's body and informational sea get contaminated by all the evil's of the world. Truly, there is no greater "demon" than this. Forcibly converting dark "mana" into lifesource is very taxing on the body.

Not only is the informational body poisoned, the curse will eat away at the user's lifeforce, resulting in the user's body to be weaker than normal while sealed.

Ultimately, a foreign body of information is injected into the user's existence and it is hard to maintain one's sanity. While unsealed, rob the user of his emotions (if this did not occur, dark emotions would overwhelm the user and cause him to go insane).

Status as a triplet (Triplet telepathy) resulted in Sion to always have a strong mind. Practice of the Miyamoto sword art's while his brother and sister went to school caused him to gain an understanding of the forbidden art.

(Lol, Sakuya style maid? Hmm... Let me think about this. Lightning will be female. Zero will be male. Aria will be mature Lightning?)

How about this. Sakuya style maid (Zero in female form) will be code named Snow White. Yeah, I like this. Then male Zero (blond). Snow White is before Zero gets Excalibur. After gets Excalibur, hair turns blond and we get Lightning/Zero/Aria.

Excalibur is ultimately a sword of "man" so it suppresses demon/god form of Zero (Snow White). Zero is not chosen by the sword and hence can't make use of its power. However, Zero can resonate with it and make use of its presence to suppress Snow White.

### Previous

Hmm, like the mix of Everdistant Horizon(Original) and Infinite Horizon, but can I modify the main character any? Though I do not know what kind of main character I am looking for, I want something different from Zero.

Actually, I still like Zero, but I might want to change her background. I like Lightning a lot and I like Lightning's background. The question is how can I improve it?

Lightning Miyamoto
Descendant of Musashi Miyamoto (Grandfather side) and King Arthur (Grandmother side). Excalibur fragments are stolen and brought to the city that Lightning lives in, jump starting the story.

Lightning, as in Lightgard. The Lightgard family is Lightning's mother side, but since she took Miyamoto name, Lightning is a reference to her past family.

Now I just need a plot/setting. Well, I have the basic plot. Lightning finds the lost Excalibur Fragment and her family comes to retrieve it. Hijinks ensue after that.

Hmm... Lightning is aware of her relationship to the Lightgard family. Perhaps they are ignorant of the relationship, or even better, they are looking for the lost relative?

Hmm... even so, I am missing a "trigger event". It is supposed to be when Lightning finds the sword but I am unsure of how to cause that to happen. Dying exorcist drops the sword off at her house/dojo and then leaves it be?

If this is Zero/Lightning story, then how does Lightning die? Perhaps that doesn't need to be decided yet and I can instead just start with Zero recovering. Now then... will this be an Infinite Horizon style sotry with Creature/Psyche/Mecha or will this be a normal story.

Advantages of having Lightning as an informational body is that she can dive through past memories through the bloodline to power up.

Advantages of having Lightning as a spirit is that she can resonate and own world/personal reality is a lot better/makes more sense.

Perhaps I should start it off with body/mind/magic? If there are clearly defined levels, then it doesn't make sense for a noob to beat a strong person. And yet, vice versa, borrowing the power of an OP person might make it work.

Body/Creature: Lightning (Miyamoto Demon Seal/Pandora)
Magic/World/Mecha: Zero (Excalibur)
Mind/Psyche: Aria?   (Personal Reality)


Body/Creature
Demon, Monster, Calamity Star,

Magic:
Sage, Magician, Wizard, Sorcerer

Mind/Psychic
Warlock? Arcanist? Esper? Level 0-5, Divine? Demigod? Deity? Philosopher? Scholar?

Magic: Magician
Pscyhe: Mystic
Creature: Guardian

Magic = Everdistant Horizon
Body/Creature = Pandora (Miyamoto Demon Seal)
Mind/Psyche: Everdistant Horizon

Thinking about it, great demon calamity is born into the world. Light happens to witness it? Or is in wrong place at wrong time? Perhaps she decides she will uphold the family legacy even though she is powerless?

Light absorbs part of the demon using the Miyamoto demon sealing art. Severely injured as a result and this also creates "Snow White". Perhaps Snow White's true name is "Raine Vesper".

Snow White is comfortable near Zero because of how Everdistant Horizon prevents the world from attacking her. Main body is sealed inside of Lightning?

Perhaps due to the nature of Everdistant Horizon, Snow White feels safe/world can not reach her anywhere inside the city. It is like a bomb that hasn't exploded yet and nobody knows when it will detonate.

Because main body is sealed inside of Lightning, feels close with Lightning. Also feels safe/protected due to the nature of Everdistant Horizon.

It is only because main body is sealed that Snow White feels the presence of Everdistant Horizon?

No, perhaps that is wrong. Snow White is an informational body born from the sealed demon that is reflected to the real world due to Everdistant Horizon. In a sense, Lightning's body is not near strong enough to hold Snow White prisoner so the seal is within the reflection of Horizon.

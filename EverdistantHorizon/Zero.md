## Zero

Quiet sobs mixed in with the pouring rain, dragging Sion's conscious up from the depths of sleep.

"I am the one who should be crying."

Sion muttered to himself as he woke up. Even after a good rest, he still had was no closer to solving his problem.

Sion stood up and looked at his rippling reflection in the puddles below.

He saw a teenager wearing a Aletheia third year uniform with brown hair and eyes the color of the setting sun. Even though the boy had just woken from a nap, his face was full of fatigue.

It had been a week and his missing brother had yet to be found. It didn't help that it was only this morning he had found out his brother went missing.

The pouring rain made it impossible to go anywhere and since his brother had gone missing a week ago, any kind of trails would have gone cold long ago. That was to say, Sion had no clues and any searching on his end would be fruitless.

I can only leave it to the professionals, Sion thought to himself with a huge sigh.

Perhaps hearing Sion's mutterings, the muffled cries quieted down from the other side of the alcove. Sion had come to a shrine as a last resort to pray for his brother's wellbeing and had got caught in a sudden downpour.

When he was lured to sleep by the pitter patter of rain, he had thought he was the only one here, but apparently someone had been on the other side of the shrine the whole time.

"I can't go back to sleep like this..."

Frowning, Sion stood up from underneath the alcove and walked to the other side of the shrine.

## Zero v2

Quiet sobs mixed in with the pouring rain, dragging Sion's conscious up from the depths of sleep.

Seeing the sheets of rain in front of him, Sion smiled bitterly.

""It's hopeless...""

A voice on the other side of the shrine let out exclaimed in surprise as her words overlapped with his.

"What is hopeless?"

Sion queried to the girl on the other side of the shrine. They both rested under the alcove of the old shrine near the Aletheia campus. It was a shrine Sion often visited to take a nap at since it was on his way home from school. There was certain ancient quality to its atmosphere that gave it the magical quality of being a perfect place for an afternoon nap.

Today a sudden shower had caught him by surprise while he was napping and there was no way he was making it back home without getting utterly drenched.

"I..." The girl hesitated for a moment before deciding to confess to the stranger, "I couldn't find the person I am looking for."

"Oh?" Sion asked as a hint of interest crept into his voice, "who are you looking for?"

"A man blessed by the heaven's with the fate and fortune to overcome any odds, triumph over any difficulties, and purify any curse."

The girl responded with a hint of reverence. Still, Sion thought, if she responded like that, then--

"--You don't know what he looks like?"

The girl remained quiet in response to Sion's question.

"That could be almost anyone. After all, Aletheia is here."

"I will know him when I see him!"

The bell like voice of the girl shouted from the other side of the shrine. Sion grew quiet hearing the determination in her voice. After a moment, he voiced his concerns too.

"I am looking for someone as well."

He looked out past the alcove of the shrine where rain fell like sheets. It wasn't even possible to see the rest of the town, creating the illusion of him and his companion being the only two people in the world. Perhaps under the spell of such a magic, he continued on further.

"He went missing a week ago but I was only notified today."

Yes, the reason he felt so helpless under the downpour today was because any possible trails had long since gone cold. Well, even if that was not the case, there was no way someone like him could do anything.

"What" a bit of hesitation crept into the girl's voice, "was his name?"

"Leonhardt, my older brother."

A long silence settled between the two. Sion thought his companion had given up on speaking when an unexpected name shattered the calm in Sion's heart.

"King Arthur. That is who I am looking for."

Sion stood up in shock. He felt as if his world was turned upside down as a sudden wave of dizziness assaulted him.

"Isn't he long dead?"

Sion replied weakly. Yet the girl's voice from the other side crushed his hopes.

"He has reincarnated into this era and is somewhere in this town. I came to this town to find him."

Proof... No, there was no point in asking for such a thing, thought Sion. After all, the girl was someone from that side of the world. There was no point in lying if she spent all that effort coming to this part of the world.
